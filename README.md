## Installation

### Use the application

* You have to clone the project locally with either/or :

```bash
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/DevWeb13/la-reponse-film.git
# SSH
git clone git@github.com:DevWeb13/la-reponse-film.git
```

* You can directly access the application at this address :

https://la-reponse-film.vercel.app/

The application is fully functional, the favorites you add are saved in the browser. You can therefore close the page and reopen it even several days later and your favorites will not have disappeared!

    
# Hi, I'm Loic! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a self-taught developer specialized in React, Javascript, HTML, CSS/SASS, GitHub, Node, Vercel, ExpressJs, Redux, VsCode, Linux and Typescript technologies. I recently completed a 14 month online javascript/React developer training which allowed me to obtain an RNCP level 6 certification as an 'Application Developer'. I am constantly learning and I like to learn new technologies. My projects are available on my Fullstack application created with 'MERN' technologies on https://www.lareponsedev.com/ (Site under construction). I am particularly concerned about code quality and use tools such as JsDoc, SonarCloud and eslint-config-airbnb to ensure this.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
